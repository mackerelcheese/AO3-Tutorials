    <p>Are you addicted to music? Do you listen to music instead of dealing with your emotions? Oh. Haha, no pffttt I have no idea what you're talking about. That can't be me.</p>
    <p>I was talking about your <i>characters.</i></p>

    <p>I'm not quite sure what this skin can be used for, I did it just to prove that I could, and therefore I did. Maybe some of you may find this useful for a HTML Fame AU or something along those lines.</p>

        <h3>First you have the overall container.</h3>
            <p>This container is for the coloured background of the Spotify app.</p>
                <code>
                    .sp-container { <br/>
                    display: block; <br/>
                    background: black; <br/>
                    max-width: 100%;<br/>
                    height: auto;<br/>
                    padding: 8px;<br/>
                    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
                    border-radius: 15px; <br/>
                }
                </code>
